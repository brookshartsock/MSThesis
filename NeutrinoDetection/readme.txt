Neutrino Detection

I calculated the IBD, neutrino CC and anti-neutrino CC interaction thresholds using thresholds.cc and sorted them using RStudio

The IBD Cross Section fit was done with xsecFit.cc

The table where I show the spectrum percentage and cross section ratio "R" where done using effectiveCrossSection.cc
