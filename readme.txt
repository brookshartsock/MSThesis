Collection of documented code used for my thesis (view only link): https://www.overleaf.com/read/pkcnvpjxwsrp#d5c935

All Geant simulations are in version Geant4.10.4 EXCEPT for the TestEm1 example which is in Geant4.10.7.

It's safe to assume all files were written by me, except for certain functions written with the help of GPT3/3.5/4 or colleages. These are commented throughout the code, except for the Geant files. Most of this code comes from examples such as LXe, B1, and TestEm1 with modifications from me. Some of these files required snipets of code, the majority of which I wrote, with occasional help from GPT/colleages. In general, some file I/O, especially reading in files, in C++ is tricky so I often worked with GPT to write these functions the first few times, and then had a working version I could edit for future purposes.
